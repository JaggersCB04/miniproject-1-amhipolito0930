<h2>2018 Spring Class Schedule</h2>
<ol>
<li>CBO4</li>
<li>7th Grade ELA</li>
<li>7th Grade Social Studies</li>
<li>Industrial Technology</li>
<li>7th Grade Math</li>
<li>7th Grade Science</li>
<li>CBO4</li>
<p>My favorite class in my opinion is probably 7th Grade Social Studies.
I like it because Mr Sears is a very cool laid back guy. Also, you can listen
to music for free and after you do all you schoolwork, you can talk to your 
friends. That is my favorite hour.
